chklinks change log

2007-06-06	version 3.03
	 1. chklinks: Added "$parser->utf8_mode(1);" in get_links($$), to
	    fix the HTML::Parser raw UTF-8 warning when extracting links from
	    UTF-8 HTML content with HTML::Parser version >= 3.40.  Thanks
	    to nsnake <loveme1314@gmail.com> for reporting this problem.
	 2. Build.PL: added.

2006-07-20
	 1. chklinks: Replaced getlogin() with getpwuid().  getlogin() many
	    not always be available, for example, when running from
	    crontab.

2006-06-08
	 1. chklinks: Revised the code with my own coding standard.
	 2. Changes: ChangeLog renamed to Changes, in order to follow Perl's
	    convention.

2006-06-01	version 3.02
	 1. SIGNATURE: Fixed.  Added the missing META.yml.
	 2. Fixes in HTML documents.

2006-05-31	version 3.01
	 1. HTML documents were missing in version 3.00.  I have put them
	    back.  I have also made a lot of changes, including Web
	    Accessibility updates.
	 2. chklinks: Updated $UASTR to use $LWP::VERSION when
	    LWP::RobotUA->_agent() is not available.  LWP::RobotUA->_agent()
	    is only available after libwww-perl version 5.53_91. (It's
	    2001-04-20, though.)
	 3. chklinks: Use File::Spec instead of File::Spec::Functions.
	    File::Spec is more compatible in older versions.
	 4. Several translated Chinese documents are added.

2006-05-30
	 1. ChangeLog: Added the forgotten version number.
	 2. Makefile.PL: Added the missing prerequisites LWP::RobotUA,
	    HTTP::Cookies and HTTP::Request.  Removed Net::HTTP that is not
	    used anymore.
	 3. chklinks: Removed the prerequisite Net::HTTP.  It is not used
	    anymore.

2006-05-30	version 3.00
	 1. Documentation fixes.

2006-05-29
	 1. Fixed the usage in usage help from chklinks.pl to chklinks.  Fixed
	    the help text from "check for" to "check against".
	 2. Change the name fetch_doc_redir() to fetch_redir() and
	    fetch_doc_noredir() to fetch_noredir().
	 3. t/00-signature.t and 99-pod.t: added.
	 4. t/htdocs: a simple test suite is created.  t/01-basic.t is rewritten
	    to use that test suite.

2006-05-28
	 1. Use warn() instead of print STDERR in warnings.
	 2. Added %ALLOWED_SCHEMES, with 5 protocols supported: http, https,
	    ftp, file and gopher, which are supported protocols common to LWP
	    and URI.
	 3. parse_args() and proc_link_val(): Modified to respect
	    %ALLOWED_SCHEMES instead of filtering out everything but HTTP.
	 4. check_links(): Fixed the comment from
	    "We will never parse the remote documents" to
	    "We are not parsing remote documents".
	 5. Removed unnecessary scalar() in parse_args() and check_links().
	 6. parse_args(): Updated the warning, change
	    "Skipping scheme-less URI" to "Skipping URI without a scheme",
	    change "Skipping hostless URI" to "Skipping URI without a host".
	 7. Use LWP::RobotUA to make request instead of making HTTP request
	    myself.  Added fetch_doc_noredir(), fetch_doc_redir(), get_ua()
	    and get_target() to replace fetch_http(), fetch_http_redir(),
	    new_http() and re_http().
	 8. Changed User-Agent text from chklinks/version to
	    chklinks-robot/version.
	 9. Use HTTP::Cookies to save and use the cookies.  As $COOKIE_JAR
	    as the common cookie jar for all the UA objects.
	10. Added noreq_key() and %NOREQ_HOSTS to prevent bothering servers
	    that are not available and returning HTTP 503.
	11. Support file:// scheme gracefully.  Added rep_uri() to report
	    the file:// URI gracefully.  Currently tested on Linux and
	    MSWin32.  More tests required.
	12. Moved chklinks from bin directory to the source root.

2006-05-27
	 1. Add the prototype declaration.
	 2. Use HTML::LinkExtor to parse and extract the links in an HTML
	    page, instead of parsing it myself.

2003-05-26	version 2.02
	 1. The default changed from onelevel to recursive.  This is more
	    desirable in most cases.
	 2. Documentation fixes.
