    chklinks is a Perl link checker.  It helps finding broken links
on your website.

    chklinks differs from linkchecker in that chklinks is
non-threaded.  It does not raises many simultaneously connections for
its job.  It won't run out of the resources and crash your system in a
moment.  This is certainly more desirable for most webmasters and
users.

    chklinks follows robots.txt rules.  If you disallow robots from
your website and experience problems, you need to allow chklinks.
Add the following lines to your robots.txt file to allow chklinks:

      User-agent: chklinks
      Disallow:

    chklinks uses LWP::RobotUA(3) and support the following schemes:
http, https, ftp, gopher, file.  You can also specify a local file.
(To use https, you need to install Crypt::SSLeay.)

    chklinks supports cookies.

    See INSTALL for instructions on how to install chklinks.

    chklinks is hosted on SourceForge, CPAN and Tavern IMACAT's.  For
