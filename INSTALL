System Requirements

   1. Perl, version 5.005 or above.  I have not tested it on earlier
versions.  Perl is distributed with most Unix now.  If not, or if you
have an older version of Perl, you can download and install/upgrade
it from Perl website.  If you are using MS-Win32, you can download
and install ActiveState ActivePerl.

   2. Required Perl modules: URI, HTML::LinkExtor, LWP::RobotUA.
HTML::LinkExtor is part of the HTML-Parser package, and LWP::RobotUA
is part of the libwww-perl package.  You can download and install them
from the CPAN archieve.  If you are installing with the CPAN or
CPANPLUS shell, they shall be automatically installed.

Installation Instruction

    chklinks uses the standard perl installation procedure.
    
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    
    You can specify a third argument for the target directories.  For
example, if you want to install it with the perl itself:
    
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=perl
    make
    make test
    make install
    
    Alternatively, if you want to install to other places:
    
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLBIN=$HOME/bin
    make
    make test
    make install
    
    See ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3) for more options on this.
