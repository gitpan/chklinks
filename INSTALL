System Requirements

   1. Perl, version 5.6 or above.  I have not successfully run this
on earlier versions. Please tell me if you can  Perl is distributed
with most Unix now.  If not, or if you have an older version of Perl,
you can download and install/upgrade it from Perl website.

http://www.perl.com/

      If you are using MS-Win32, you can download and install
ActiveState ActivePerl.

http://www.activestate.com/

   2. Required Perl modules: URI, HTML::LinkExtor and LWP::RobotUA.
HTML::LinkExtor is part of the HTML-Parser package, and LWP::RobotUA
is part of the libwww-perl package.  You can download and install
them from the CPAN archieve.

http://www.cpan.org/

      If you are installing with the CPAN or CPANPLUS shell, they
shall be automatically installed.

   3. Optional Perl modules:
   
     * Crypt::SSLeay

      This is needed for LWP::RobotUA to support HTTPS.

Installation Instruction

    chklinks uses standard Perl installation with ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
Follow these steps:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

    When running make install, make sure you have the priviledge to
write to the instalation location.  This usually requires the root
priviledge.

    If you are using ActivePerl under MSWin32, you should use nmake
instead of make. nmake can be obtained from the Microsoft FTP site.

ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

    If you want to install into another location, you can set the
PREFIX.  For example, to install into your home when you are not
root:

    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/jessica

    Refer to the docuemntation of ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more
installation options (by running perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker).
